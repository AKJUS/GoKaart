## Application architecture

## External assets

A number of assets used in the app come from other repositories, and should be periodically updated. Because updating these items can be a lengthy process it is performed manually rather than at build time:
- iD presets database (https://github.com/openstreetmap/id-tagging-schema) 
- iD presets icons (https://github.com/ideditor/temaki, https://github.com/mapbox/maki)
- Name Suggestion Index (https://github.com/osmlab/name-suggestion-index)
- NSI brand imagery (pulled from Facebook/Twitter/Wikipedia)
- StreetComplete quest filters (https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete)
- Weblate translations (https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/go-map/app)

### Updating external assets

```sh
cd src
(cd presets && ./update.sh)			# fetches latest presets.json, etc. files and NSI
(cd presets && ./getBrandIcons.py)		# downloads images from various websites and converts them to PNG as necessary
(cd presets && ./uploadBrandIcons.sh)	# uploads imagery to gomaposm.com where they can be downloaded on demand at runtime (password required)
(cd POI-Icons && ./update.sh)			# fetches Maki/Temaki icons 
(cd xliff && ./update.sh)				# downloads latest translations from Weblate (API token required). The output is very noisy and can be ignored
```

## Formatting

In order to have a consistent code style, please make sure to install
[SwiftFormat][6] and run it on a regular basis. Consider setting up a `pre-commit`
Git hook, as described [here][7].

## Presets and translation

Go Map!! is using iD presets, so you can improve translations [by improving translations of iD presets](https://github.com/openstreetmap/id-tagging-schema).
