# Go Map!!

Go Map!! is an iPhone/iPad editor for adding cartographic information to [OpenStreetMap](www.openstreetmap.org).


## Source

The project began as a Mac desktop editor, but soon changed to an iPhone app, but with an eye toward working on both platforms. As a result the **src** directory contains subdirectories **iOS**, **Mac** and **Shared**. The Mac code is not maintained and probably won't build, but core code is written with an eye toward potentially supporting Mac again in the future.
